          Musk did not attend Harvard himself, but he is such an iconic leader
          that people smarter than him in certain aspects gravitate towards him
          to work for him.

          Musk is the current CEO & Chief Product Architect of Tesla, Inc., a
          company that makes electric vehicles. He is also the CEO of Solar
          City, a company that makes solar panels, and the CEO & CTO of SpaceX,
          an aerospace company.

          Projects: At the end of 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company which
          focuses on tunneling and infrastructure. He mentioned Los Angeles
          traffic as the reason for starting this company. In March 2017 Elon
          Musk announced he had started another company that aimed to merge
          human brains with computers called Neuralink

          From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California,
          where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[487] He then relocated to
          Texas, saying that California had become "complacent" about its
          economic success.[487][488] While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021,
          Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been
          medically diagnosed.[489][490] Musk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu
          while preparing for the proposed fight between himself and Mark
          Zuckerberg.[491] In his leisure time, he plays video games including
          Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.
